Here you will see how the things get change how ml algorithims are then and how this deep learning neural network concept came in exit  

# [ Deep Learning and neural networks](https://github.com/samirdahal888/Deep-Learning/tree/main/History)  
 This  covers
  Understanding perceptrons and multilayer 
perceptrons
  Working with the different types of activation 
functions
  Training networks with feedforward, error 
functions, and error optimization
  Performing backpropagation

Here you will see how the things get change how ml algorithims are then and how this deep learning neural network concept came in exit  

# [ Deep Learning and neural networks](https://github.com/samirdahal888/Deep-Learning/tree/main/History)  
 This  covers
 1.  ### Understanding perceptrons and multilayer 
perceptrons  

 2. ### Working with the different types of activation 
functions 

 3.  ### Training networks with feedforward, error 
functions, and error optimization  

 4. ### Performing backpropagation
